So here's the thing, I recently got into a code-golfing beef with a bro about a peculiar topic.
<br>Here's how the convo played out:
        </div>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">...
bro: so as an embedded dev I can say zig's better
bro: in everything
bro: for embedded systems 
me:  &lt;dies from exposure to large dose of gamma-ziggiation>
me:  >social credit -5000000
bro: huh
bro: well atleast I don't need multiple files to make an os lmfao
me:  what sane person would want to write an OS using one source file..
bro: can you write a basic hello world OS in C in just one file of source code
me:  yes
bro: aha
bro: show
bro: and in how many lines
bro: cuz zig can do it elegantly in 27 lines
me:  i will
bro: eager to see it
me:  27 lines, i'd like to see this "elegance"
...
</code></pre>
<div class="pindex">    
and this is when bro pasted the following piece of Zig code:
</div>
<pre><code>
 -------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1   | const builtin = @import("builtin");
    2   | const MultiBoot = packed struct {
    3   |     magic: i32,
    4   |     flags: i32,
    5   |     checksum: i32,
    6   | };
    7   |
    8   | const ALIGN = 1 << 0;
    9   | const MEMINFO = 1 << 1;

   15   |     .flags = FLAGS,
   16   |     .checksum = -(MAGIC + FLAGS),
   17   | };
   18   |
   19   | export var stack_bytes: [16 * 1024]u8 align(16) linksection(".bss") = undefined;

<div class="pindex">as a true whacked-over-the-head C supremacist, the syntax immediately burned my eyes and i couldn't really make sense of some parts of the code,
specifically the function headers of `_start` and `panic`.
<br>it especially didn't help that i couldn't look at the disassembly, because this piece of zig refused to compile, even though it's just some copy-pasta <img src="images/shaggy_creenge.png" alt="supa cringe" height="24" width="24">
<br>anyways.... to skip the point that bro was <em><span style="color:lime;">attempting</span></em> to make:
</div>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">...
bro: `@call(.{ .stack = stack_bytes_slice }, kmain, .{});` <----
bro: \> can you even do that in C?                             |
bro: C uses default stack by default                           |
bro: this. do this in C ----------------------------------------

<div class="pindex">
so as you can imagine, i was not having this ziggler uprising and i started to speculate how tf was i gonna do this in C.
quick googling got me to <a style="color:orange" href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/22794334">stackoverflow</a>, which shat on me even more:
</div>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">C code requires for example a stack to be setup, so if nothing else you need to set the stack pointer before you enter the first level of code.
<br>And from C (not counting inline asm which in this case would be assembly not C) you cant set the stack pointer.
<br>So you have that chicken and egg problem.
</code></pre>
<div class="pindex">realizing i'm all alone in this battle, i started with the idea of rewriting Bruce's C Compiler
to introduce new keywords, to which i got the following response from bro:
</div>
<pre><code class="language-plaintext">...
bro: I don't want a codebase I want a few lines of code
bro: I want something like this without assembly and not a f!#*king 20 line turd &lt;again referring to the same line of code>
bro: whatever it is you're not doing it in one line bro
bro: or two
bro: or three
bro: so cope
</code></pre>
<div class="pindex">as you can imagine, i was ready to pop this little dipshmuck one, so he'd be busy examining the diff file of the number of teeth he spits out and swallows. jk, there's love everywhere.
<br>but then i started 50iq brainstorming real hard, even though my hands were shaking from rage. after all, C supremacy was in danger and i was the dirt shield in the first line of defense.
<br>at first, i was gonna just blatantly write the following array of bytes:
</div>
<pre><code>unsigned char esp[] = { 0xBC, 0x10, 0x00, 0x10, 0x00 }; // i.e. mov esp, 0x100010
</code></pre>
<div class="pindex">but even i can admit that's just cheating and is basically the same as using inline assembly.
<br>i started thinking about ways to abuse the C compiler, but i was stuck in the Garden of C-den and the realm surely posed some limitations. i <em>somehow</em> needed to modify the SP register.
<br>so what is the key to the hole of "when does the compiler do this"? you're right, <span style="color:cyan;">stack-based local variables!!!</span>
<br>immediately after this holy revelation smacked my face, i fired up <span style="color:yellow;">Bochs</span> with VGA BIOS to see what the ESP register looks right upon landing on empty `kmain()`.
<br>and the answer is <span style="color:lime;">0x6f04</span>. next, i did the same thing with <span style="color:orange;">QEMU</span> with SeaBIOS, and to my surprise, it was the same value!
<br>where did this come from? i don't give a damn! okay maybe i do, but that's a topic for future ramblings. all that matters is, that now i only need to create an array big enough to overflow the ESP register and make it land exactly at the address of our stack.
<br>so after hardcore MIT math, to force the compiler to generate `sub esp, 0x...`, all i need to do is this:
</div>
<pre><code>volatile char _shift[0xFFF06CD0];
</code></pre>
<div class="pindex">so i quickly fed GCC some args and prepared myself to see magic:</div>
<pre><code>kernel.c:14:19: error: size of array `_shift` is too large
   14 |     unsigned char _shift[0xFFF06CD0];
      |
</code></pre>
<div class="pindex">well sheese, how about tcc?</div>
<pre><code>kernel.c:14: error: invalid array size</code></pre>
<div class="pindex">well alr, third time's a clang.. !!!AND IT WORKED!!! see for yourself:</div>

    return;

<div class="pindex">so yea, we've created a stack of 512 (-4 reserved) bytes in size. let's count on one hand the number of lines required for setting it up:</div>
<pre><code>unsigned char _shift[0xFFF06CD0];                           /* this is one */
