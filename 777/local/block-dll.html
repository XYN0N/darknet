            Patching DLL entry points to bypass AVs/EDRs hooks
        </div>
        <div class="pindex">
            Many AV/EDR solutions at least partialy rely on user-mode API hooking in order to detect malicious behavior in real-time.
            <br>This API hooking is usually done by injecting a DLL into user processes, which allows the product (AV/EDR) to monitor suspicious activity during runtime.
            <br>I've tested this technique against many products, including Avast, Comodo, McAfee and F-Secure just to name a few. So let's pick Avast as our target for this demo.
            <br>Using <a target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 255, 0);" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/">Sysinternals' Process Explorer</a>, we can inspect separate processes to see what DLLs have been loaded into them.
            <br>The process of interest will be <b>Dummy.exe</b>:
        </div>
        <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h>
#include &lt;Windows.h>

int main(void) {

    printf("[+] PID => %d\n", GetCurrentProcessId());
    while (1);

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre>
        <div class="pindex">
            In the lower pane of Process Explorer, we can see that a DLL with name <i>`aswhook.dll`</i> has been loaded into our process immediately at startup:
        </div>
        <br>
        <img src="images/Dummy_Avast_DLL.png" alt="avasthook">
        <br><br>
        <div class="pindex">
            Patching the entry point of a DLL won't amount to much once the DLL is loaded and has already executed it's <i>`DllMain()`</i> function (most likely to create a new thread inside the process),
            <br>so the entry point has to be patched before the execution takes place.
            <br>To achieve this, the target process can be created by another <b>"spawner"</b> process, which will act and serve as a debugger to our target.
            <br>The <i>`DEBUG_EVENT`</i> structure provides a lot of useful information, but for this purpose, the main point of interest will be the <i>`LOAD_DLL_DEBUG_INFO`</i> debug event:
        </div>
        <pre><code>/* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/minwinbase/ns-minwinbase-debug_event */
typedef struct _DEBUG_EVENT {
    DWORD dwDebugEventCode;
    DWORD dwProcessId;
    DWORD dwThreadId;
    union {
        EXCEPTION_DEBUG_INFO      Exception;
        CREATE_THREAD_DEBUG_INFO  CreateThread;
        CREATE_PROCESS_DEBUG_INFO CreateProcessInfo;
        EXIT_THREAD_DEBUG_INFO    ExitThread;
        EXIT_PROCESS_DEBUG_INFO   ExitProcess;
        LOAD_DLL_DEBUG_INFO       LoadDll;              /* Reports a load-dynamic-link-library (DLL) debugging event.
                                                         * The value of u.LoadDll specifies a LOAD_DLL_DEBUG_INFO structure. */
        UNLOAD_DLL_DEBUG_INFO     UnloadDll;
        OUTPUT_DEBUG_STRING_INFO  DebugString;
        RIP_INFO                  RipInfo;
    } u;
} DEBUG_EVENT, *LPDEBUG_EVENT;</code></pre>
        <div class="pindex">
            We can create a new process using the <i>`CreateProcess()`</i> function, which <a target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 255, 0);" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/process-creation-flags">Process Creation Flags</a> can be set to <i>`DEBUG_PROCESS`</i>:
            <pre><code>`DEBUG_PROCESS` - The calling thread starts and debugs the new process and all child processes created by the new process. It can receive all related debug events using the WaitForDebugEvent function.</pre></code>
            By gluing all of this together, the debugger will be able to break the debuggee every time a new DLL is loaded, effectively before executing any of it's code.
            <br>The entry point can now be patched as simply as rewriting the first byte with <i>`(BYTE) 0xc3`</i> - the opcode for <a target="_blank" style="color: rgb(0, 255, 0);" href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/ret.html">RET</a> instruction.
            <br>Now let's see the result in action:
